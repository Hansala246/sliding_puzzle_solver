# Sliding_Puzzle_Solver

### Overview
This project implements a sliding puzzles solver using pathfinding algorithms in Java. The goal is to navigate from the starting point 'S' to the finish point 'F' on a map filled with obstacles, where the player slides in a chosen direction until encountering a wall or an obstacle.

### Features
The solver features efficient data structures for representing maps, a robust parser for reading map configurations from input files, and an algorithm to find the shortest path from 'S' to 'F'. The project also includes a performance analysis of the implemented algorithm, providing insights into its efficiency and effectiveness.

### Implementation
The project is structured to allow easy modification and extension. The main components include a map representation, a parser for input files, and the pathfinding algorithm. The algorithm outputs the steps required to solve the puzzle, ensuring a clear and concise solution path.
